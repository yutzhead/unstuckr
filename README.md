# unstuckr: Fix stuck pixels.

Unstuckr intends to fix stuck pixel on your display. Unlike other software

- Your computer remains usable
- It doesn't give you seizures

(especially when you only flash the stuck pixel)

Usage: unstuckr.py &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; [&lt;rectangle size&gt;]

Default rectangle size is 1, which flashes only the stuck pixel.
